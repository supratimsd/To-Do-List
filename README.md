# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



A "to-do list" is a simple and effective tool for organizing tasks and managing time. It is a list of items or tasks that one needs to accomplish, typically written down in a systematic way. The purpose of a to-do list is to provide a clear overview of what needs to be done, prioritize tasks, and keep track of progress.
